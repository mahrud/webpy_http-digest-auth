webpy_http-digest-auth
======================

Web.py Implementation of HTTP Digest Authentication (RFC2617)

This is just an implementation experiment. DON'T USE IT, IT USES MD5 WHICH IS 
TOTALLY AND CATASTROPHICALLY BROKEN. I've used HTTP Digest Auth with Squid 
cache-server before. This is a minimal but working code. Some features are yet 
to be implemented. NOT to be used in production, D'UH!

see <https://github.com/mahrud/webpy_http-digest-auth> for more info.
