webpy_http-digest-auth
======================

Web.py Implementation of HTTP Digest Authentication (RFC2617)

This is mostly an experiment. I've had used HTTP Digest Auth with Squid Cache-
server before. This is a minimal but working code. Some features are yet to be
implemented. NOT to be used in production unless you understand every single 
line of the code.

see <http://algorithms.jux-foundation.org/~mahrud/blog/> for more info.
